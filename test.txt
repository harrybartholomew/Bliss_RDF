                     *   Alternative (not recommended) for libraries
                         wishing to keep all individuals in one simple
                         A/Z file, rather than subordinating them to
                         period & place, e.g. at AD. Other alternatives
                         for A/Z arrangements will be found under
                         Western & under Oriental philosophy (at AB8,
                         AE and AI8).

                         of each philosopher, e.g. AA8 KAN for KANT.
                     *   For subdivision of an individual philosopher's

                         metaphilosophical enquiry & when it covers
                         both Western & Oriental traditions.
