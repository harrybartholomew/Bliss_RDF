                         one viewpoint by another can be specified by
                         normal retroactive synthesis. For example, an
                         empiricist treatment (ABH) of the subject
                         existentialism (ACT L) would be ACT LBH.
                     *   Note that qualification by a viewpoint from
                         which a subject is treated can only be made
                         after the exact subject has been specified
                         (this is the normal BC2 rule for all forms of

                         level, without local divisions). Then within
                         each place, divide by individual philosophers
                         & their schools.
                     *   Individual philosophers may be qualified by
                         Auxiliary Schedule AA2. For well-known
                         philosophers classmarks are given, and these
                         may be qualified directly by Auxiliary
                         Schedule AA2. When notation is provided for an
                         alphabetical span of names (e.g. ADR Q Pic -
                         Su), add two letters for the names of
                         individuals in accordance with section 10.82
                         of the introduction. When no notation for
                         names is provided under a period and country
                         (as at ADS G Spanish 17th century philosophy),
                         add three letters for the name of an
                         individual. These alphabetical devices may
                         then be qualified by Auxiliary Schedule AA2.

                     *   In the modern period the philosophy of a

                         this an alternative is provided at ADP where

                         short periods. So Schedule 4 is not used here
                         & periods are enumerated.

                     *   Within each period classes produced
                         retroactively are then followed by specific
                         countries & within each country by special
                         schools & by individual philosophers of the
                         period.
                     *   Any individual philosopher may be qualified by

                     *   In this period the significance of nation
                         states was relatively undeveloped in
                         philosophy and so place is cited after
                         doctrines, etc. and the nationality of
                         individuals is ignored.

                         Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.
                         But systematic works (such as Spinoza's Ethics
                         or Bradley's Appearance and Reality) which are

                     *   Citation order here differs from that for
                         Western philosophy. This reflects three
                         important differences:
                     *   Firstly, historical schools are usually
                         regarded as the primary point of departure in
                         the study of the literature.
                     *   Secondly, the schools are characterised by a
                         combination of religious criteria & place.
                     *   Thirdly, within a defining religious or moral
                         system the concept of a school is closely
                         related to that of major writers or works in
                         the subject, which then constitute
                         quasi-schools of their own. Associated with
                         this feature is the prominence attaching to
                         the idea of a `classic' forming the root from
                         which may develop a large interpretative
                         literature in the form of commentaries,
                         `sutras' (formulae), etc.
                     *   So the arrangement below is basically by
                         religious system, but with a clustering under
                         place where the religion is inextricably bound
                         up with its place of origin (notably in the
                         case of India & China). The filing order of
                         the religions is designed to collocate with
                         Western philosophy those systems having a very
                         close connection with it (i.e. Judaism &
                         Islam).
                     *   Qualification of an Eastern system by
                         Viewpoints & doctrines and by Branches is
                         effected by adding letters B/H following A
                         (for Western philosophy, which gives these in
                         full detail) supplemented by doctrines etc.
                         special to Eastern philosophies. But for Logic
                         use the classmark provided under Branches at
                         AHA, e.g. Nyaya logic AIP CHA. A summary guide

AK              01Science of science, Formal science, Abstract science,
                           Scientia
                     *   Science in its broadest sense. Includes
                         'formal' science of logic and mathematics as
                         well as empirical sciences (natural and
                         social) and those applications often described
                         as `sciences' (e.g. medical sciences,
                         engineering sciences, information sciences).
                         It excludes only the Humanities (Philosophy,
                         history, religion, arts, philology). For works
                         on a particular science, see the appropriate
                         class (e.g. B Physics, HM Medicine).
                     *   The connections of science with technology as
                         a whole area are very close, both conceptually
                         and bibliographically. So separate provision
                         is made for them, when treated together, in
                         AY. Class AY also takes that literature which
                         considers the detailed methods, techniques,
                         instrumentation, etc of science and technology
                         and their concrete relations with social
                         products since it is very difficult to
                         distinguish the literature on these aspects of
                         the two classes.
                     *   So this class AK is restricted mainly to the
                         more general and abstract consideration of
                         pure science as a major form of knowledge. For
                         scientific research, practise of science, etc.

                         historical schools & are consequently cited
                         after specific problems in logic.
