                     *   Studies in which reasoning is the fundamental
                         instrument, whether or not combined with
                         observation and experiment.
                     *   For the organization of knowledge and the
                         relations between different disciplines, see

                     *   Use these instead of 9C/9K, if necessary. Most
                         of the relations occur as integral classes
                         within the philosophy schedule (e.g. in
                         metaphilosophy - especially at AFX). When in
                         doubt, prefer the enumerated classes.

                         to the subject being influenced.

                         whole classification.
@               02General philosophy
                     *   For works dealing with both Western and
                         Oriental philosophy. DO NOT USE AA7/AAH for
                         works confined to a particular broad tradition
                         (Western or Oriental). Use AA for completely
                         general works.
                     *   Much the greater part of the literature in
                         most libraries relates to a particular broad
                         tradition and relatively little will fall in
                         AA7/AAH. For this reason, the detailed
                         enumeration of the two major facets
                         (Viewpoints & doctrines, and Branches) is
                         given under Western philosophy (AB/AH) and the
                         truly general classes at AA7/AAH are extracted
                         from these.
                     *   Alternative (not recommended) whereby Western
                         and Oriental are treated simply like
                         historical schools is given at AA7.
